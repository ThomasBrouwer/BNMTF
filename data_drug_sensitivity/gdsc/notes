*** ic50_excl_empty_filtered_cell_lines_drugs.txt ***
The original file from website is called gdsc_manova_input_w5.csv (this file has all the genetic info etc filtered, leaving only the IC50 values).
We removed row with drug AZD6482 (PubChem id 44137675) as there are two columns with that drug (removed the first one).
Filtered rows 57 and 635 because they had only 2 resp. 1 drug tested. 
Only included those cancer cell lines that have features available (en_input_w5.csv). The cancer cell lines are also ordered alphabetically (so that they align perfectly with the cell line kernels/constraint matrices).
Also removed the drug Cisplatin (PubChem id 84691) and reordered columns alphabetically (so that they align perfectly with the drug and cancer line kernels/constraint matrices). 
Finally, removed one value (-36.485443) as this was an extreme outlier (next lowest value around -17).
We end up with: 622 cell lines, 138 drugs

*** ic50_excl_empty_filtered_cell_lines_drugs_standardised.txt ***
As above, but standardised the cell lines (so each row has mean 0, std 1).
We end up with: 622 cell lines, 138 drugs.

*** /kernels/ ***
The different similarity kernels, based on drug and cell line features. 
For binary features we use a Jaccard kernel.
For real-valued features we use a Gaussian kernel with as the kernel standard deviation value: (no. features) / 4.
